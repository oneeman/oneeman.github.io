I'm a software developer based in Costa Rica, from where I've been doing remote work.  My professional experience has
been primarily using Python and Javascript, and a bit of Ruby on Rails.  Lately, I've jumped on the functional 
programming bandwagon.  I'm currently focusing on Elixir and Haskell, but I've also learned some Clojure and Erlang.

Starting in April 2015, I'm taking some time off from paid work to dive deeper into functional programming and to
dedicate more time to working on open-source projects.  But I'll be back on the market shortly, so if you're looking to
hire a functional programmer and can accommodate remote work, feel free to email me.

When it comes to open-source, I like to contribute to established projects.  I got started contributing to Ember's
[HTMLBars](http://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars).  Lately I've been working on the
[Elixir compiler and standard libraries](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir).  Going forward, my plan is to continue
to work on Elixir and to also start work on some Haskell projects once I've learned the language well enough.
  
## Experience

* **Python Engineer** at [Demand Media](http://www.demandmedia.com) (contracting through 
[BairesDev](http://bairesdev.com)), June 2014-March 2015.  Full-stack development on the datacenter automation
project.  The back-end was written in Python, using the excellent [Eve](https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve) library
for a JSON REST API backed by MongoDB, while the front-end used AngularJS.

* **Created the website** for [Escaz√∫ Music Academy](http://www.escazumusic.com) (off-hours, June 2014-July 2014).  It's a static
site using a responsive Bootstrap template, but I used Ruby on Rails so as to reduce duplication and speed up 
development.

* **Software Developer** at [Net Data Direct](http://netdatadirect.com), May 2013-September 2013.  Worked on the 
company's data warehousing application, as we transitioned from PostgreSQL to a mostly NoSQL system using Cassandra and
Redis.

* **Mathematics Teacher** at the [Blue Valley School](http://www.bluevalley.ed.cr/), July 2011-December 2011.  Taught
three classes of high school mathematics.

* **Various teaching gigs** at the University of Pittsburgh, Fall 2003-Spring 2011.  Taught and served as a teaching
assistant for several courses in the mathematics and philosophy departments. 

## Education

* **Ph.D. candidate in Philosophy**, University of Pittsburgh, ABD (withdrew April 2011).
