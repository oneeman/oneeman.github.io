I'm a software developer based in Costa Rica, from where I've been doing remote work.  My professional experience has
been primarily using Python and Javascript, and a bit of Ruby on Rails.  Lately I've jumped on the functional 
programming bandwagon, and am currently learning Elixir, having learned a bit of Scala and Clojure previously. 
I've also contributed a bit to open-source projects, most of all to [HTMLBars](http://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars).
  
## Experience

* **Python Engineer** at [Demand Media](http://www.demandmedia.com) (contracting through 
[BairesDev](http://bairesdev.com)), June 2014-present.  Doing full-stack development on the datacenter automation
project.  The back-end is written in Python, and uses the excellent [Eve](https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve) library
for a JSON REST API backed by MongoDB, while the front-end uses AngularJS.

* **Created the website** for [Escaz√∫ Music Academy](http://www.escazumusic.com) (off-hours, June 2014-July 2014).  It's a static
site using a responsive Bootstrap template, but I used Ruby on Rails so as to reduce duplication and speed up 
development.

* **Software Developer** at [Net Data Direct](http://netdatadirect.com), May 2013-September 2013.  Worked on the 
company's data warehousing application, as we transitioned from PostgreSQL to a mostly NoSQL system using Cassandra and
Redis.

* **Mathematics Teacher** at the [Blue Valley School](http://www.bluevalley.ed.cr/), July 2011-December 2011.  Taught
three classes of high school mathematics.

* **Various teaching gigs** at the University of Pittsburgh, Fall 2003-Spring 2011.  Taught and served as a teaching
assistant for several courses in the mathematics and philosophy departments.
