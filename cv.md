I'm a software developer based in Costa Rica, from where I've been doing remote work.  My professional experience is as
a full-stack web developer, primarily with Python, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails.  I care deeply about writing
clean and maintainable code, supported by comprehensive automated tests.
   
I was recently admitted to Georgia Tech's 
[Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS)](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) program, and will be starting
classes there in Spring 2016.    

I am also a fan of functional programming, having learned Clojure, Elixir, Erlang, Scala, and Haskell.  I look forward
to using some of them more in the future.

When it comes to open-source, I like to contribute to established projects, having made contributions to projects such
as Ember's [HTMLBars](http://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars) and the
[Elixir compiler and standard libraries](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir).
  
## Experience

* **Software Developer (contracting)** at [ThriveHive](http://thrivehive.com), June 2015-present.  Front-end development
on the company's customer-facing single-page application.

* **Python Engineer** at [Demand Media](http://www.demandmedia.com) (contracting through 
[BairesDev](http://bairesdev.com)), June 2014-March 2015.  Full-stack development on the datacenter automation
project.  The back-end was written in Python, using the excellent [Eve](https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve) library
for a JSON REST API backed by MongoDB, while the front-end used AngularJS.

* **Created the website** for [Escaz√∫ Music Academy](http://www.escazumusic.com) (off-hours, June 2014-July 2014).  It's a static
site using a responsive Bootstrap template, but I used Ruby on Rails so as to reduce duplication and speed up 
development.

* **Software Developer** at [Net Data Direct](http://netdatadirect.com), May 2013-September 2013.  Worked on the 
company's data warehousing application, as we transitioned from PostgreSQL to a mostly NoSQL system using Cassandra and
Redis.

three classes of high school mathematics.

assistant for several courses in the mathematics and philosophy departments.
