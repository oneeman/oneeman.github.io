I'm a software developer based in Costa Rica, from where I've been doing remote work.  My professional experience has
been primarily using Python and Javascript, and a bit of Ruby on Rails.  Lately, I've jumped on the functional 
programming bandwagon.  After learning Clojure, Elixir, and Erlang, I've settled on statically-typed functional
languages, and Haskell and Scala in particular.

When it comes to open-source, I like to contribute to established projects.  I got started contributing to Ember's
[HTMLBars](http://github.com/tildeio/htmlbars).  After that, I worked on the
[Elixir compiler and standard libraries](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir).  Going forward, my plan is to continue
to learn Haskell and Scala and--once I've gotten far enough along with them--to start contributing to projects in one or
both of those.
  
## Experience

* **Software Engineer (contractor)** at [ThriveHive](http://thrivehive.com), June 2015-present.  Front-end development
on the company's customer-facing single-page application.

* **Python Engineer** at [Demand Media](http://www.demandmedia.com) (contracting through 
[BairesDev](http://bairesdev.com)), June 2014-March 2015.  Full-stack development on the datacenter automation
project.  The back-end was written in Python, using the excellent [Eve](https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve) library
for a JSON REST API backed by MongoDB, while the front-end used AngularJS.

* **Created the website** for [Escaz√∫ Music Academy](http://www.escazumusic.com) (off-hours, June 2014-July 2014).  It's a static
site using a responsive Bootstrap template, but I used Ruby on Rails so as to reduce duplication and speed up 
development.

* **Software Developer** at [Net Data Direct](http://netdatadirect.com), May 2013-September 2013.  Worked on the 
company's data warehousing application, as we transitioned from PostgreSQL to a mostly NoSQL system using Cassandra and
Redis.

* **Mathematics Teacher** at the [Blue Valley School](http://www.bluevalley.ed.cr/), July 2011-December 2011.  Taught
three classes of high school mathematics.

* **Various teaching gigs** at the University of Pittsburgh, Fall 2003-Spring 2011.  Taught and served as a teaching
assistant for several courses in the mathematics and philosophy departments. 

## Education
