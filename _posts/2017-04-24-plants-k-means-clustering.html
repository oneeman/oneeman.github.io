  <p>
    For this, the first post on this blog, I will be looking at the results of running the k-means clustering algorithm on the USDA's Plants dataset.
    As we will see, the algorithm manages to reveal geographical information which is not explicitly represented in the dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin, let us examine the kind of data we'll be dealing with.
    The Plants dataset (among many others) is <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/plants" target="_blank">available for download</a> at UCI's machine learning repository.
    It contains a listing of 34,781 plant genera and species, and the states (or provinces) in the US and Canada in which each is found.
    For example, these are the first five lines of the data file:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-">
    abelia,fl,nc
    abelia x grandiflora,fl,nc
    abelmoschus,ct,dc,fl,hi,il,ky,la,md,mi,ms,nc,sc,va,pr,vi
    abelmoschus esculentus,ct,dc,fl,il,ky,la,md,mi,ms,nc,sc,va,pr,vi
    abelmoschus moschatus,hi,pr
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Each line contains the plant's name and a list of the states it's found in.
    The states are identified by abbreviations, and <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/plants/stateabbr.txt" target="_blank">a separate file</a> lists what each abbreviation stands for.
    There are 69 states overall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before running k-means, we need to do a bit of preprocessing, to convert this into the right form:
    <ol>
      <li>Decide on an ordering to use for the states (alphabetical by abbreviation is natural enough)</li>
      <li>Parse the list of states each plant is present in (and discard the plant's name)</li>
      <li>Encode each plant as a row of 0s and 1s, 1s for those states it's found in and 0s for the rest</li>
    </ol>

    This gives us the dataset in the form a matrix with 34,781 rows and 69 columns.
