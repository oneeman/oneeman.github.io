In proportion as our inward life fails, we go more constantly and desperately to the post-office.

The mountain forests, the great open plains! Shall they make me joyful, shall they fill me with happiness? But even

If we were to uproot only one vice each year, we should soon become perfect. The contrary, however, is often the
case--we feel that we were better and purer in the first fervor of our conversion than we are after many years in the
practice of our faith. Our fervor and progress ought to increase day by day; yet it is now considered noteworthy if
a man can retain even a part of his first fervor.    
--- Thomas a Kempis, The Imitation of Christ.

The same fire that melts the butter hardens the egg.

The other morning I heard a four-year-old girl ask her mother, "Why was I born into this world? To go to nursery
school?" Naturally her mother could not honestly say, "Yes, that's right, so off you go." And yet, you could say that
people these days are born to go to nursery school.    
--- Masanobu Fukuoka, The One-Straw Revolution

Insincere Speech, truly, is the prime material of insincere Action.

When you are angry, does it feel good or bad? If it feels bad, why don't you throw it away? How can you say that you
are wise and intelligent when you hold on to such things?    
--- Ajahn Chah

Defilements are like a stray cat. If you give it as much food as it wants it will always be coming around looking for
more food, but if you stop feeding it, after a couple of days it'll stop coming around. It's the same with the
defilements, they won't come to disturb you, they'll leave your mind in peace. So rather than being afraid of
defilement, make the defilements afraid of you.    
--- Ajahn Chah

In truth, you must be pretty foolish if you find living on your own causes you suffering. If you find living in a
community with lots of people is a lot of suffering, you are equally foolish. It's like chicken shit. If you are
walking on your own somewhere carrying chicken shit, it stinks. If there is a whole group of people walking around
carrying chicken shit, it stinks just the same.    
--- Ajahn Chah

To search for what is beyond the actual is to be caught in illusion.    
--- J. Krishnamurti

Do you know why you cannot wait for the shot and why you get out of breath before it has come? The right shot at the
right moment does not come because you do not let go of yourself. You do not wait for fulfillment, but brace yourself
for failure. So long as that is so, you have no choice but to call forth something yourself that ought to happen
independently of you, and so long as you call it forth your hand will not open in the right way---like the hand of a
child. Your hand does not burst open like the skin of a ripe fruit.    
--- Zen in the Art of Archery (Eugen Herrigel)

Do not fear the arising of thoughts, just fear being slow to notice them.    
--- Zen saying

"Whatever has to happen, let it happen!"    
"Whatever the situation is, it's fine!"    
"I really don't need anything!"    
--- The Three Fierce Mantras of Tsangpa Gyare
