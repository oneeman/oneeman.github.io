a man can retain even a part of his first fervor.

One law of international value is maintainable in any form: namely, that the farther your neighbour lives from you,

Defilements are like a stray cat. If you give it as much food as it wants it will always be coming around looking for
more food, but if you stop feeding it, after a couple of days it'll stop coming around. It's the same with the

defilement, make the defilements afraid of you.  
--- Ajahn Chah

In truth, you must be pretty foolish if you find living on your own causes you suffering. If you find living in a

carrying chicken shit, it stinks just the same.  
--- Ajahn Chah

Do you know why you cannot wait for the shot and why you get out of breath before it has come? The right shot at the
right moment does not come because you do not let go of yourself. You do not wait for fulfillment, but brace yourself
for failure. So long as that is so, you have no choice but to call forth something yourself that ought to happen
independently of you, and so long as you call it forth your hand will not open in the right way---like the hand of a
child. Your hand does not burst open like the skin of a ripe fruit.  
--- Zen in the Art of Archery (Eugen Herrigel)
